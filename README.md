## async_FIFO design
This asynchronous FIFO design is based entirely on Cliff Cummingâ€™s paper [Simulation and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf). 

## Plan
1. [x] Create the Async FIFO. (Done)
2. [x] Try the basec verilog TB. (Done)
3. [x] Try the UVM verification. (Done)

## Status.
1. 2020.09.06: Basic RTL done.
2. 2020.09.06: Basic verilog TB done.
3. 2020.09.17: UVM verification TB done.

## About the UVM verification.
The UVM verification codes are learned are refered to Zhangqiang's book.
