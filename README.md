## async_FIFO
This asynchronous FIFO design is based entirely on Cliff Cummingâ€™s paper [Simulation and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf). 

## Plan
1. Create the Async FIFO.
2. Try the basec verilog TB.
3. Try the UVM way of verification.

## Status.
1. 2020.09.06: Basic RTL done.
2. 2020.09.06: Basic verilog TB done.
